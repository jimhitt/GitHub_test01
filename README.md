# Command Line Wordle

A Python-based command line version of the popular word-guessing game Wordle.


## About

This project is a simple implementation of Wordle, a word-guessing game, in Python. It provides a command line interface for users to play the game, guessing a five-letter word within six attempts. The project is a part of my Python learning journey and experimentation with command line applications.

## Features

* Feedback on letters is displayed similar to the online version:
  * Green: correct letter and correct position
  * Yellow: correct letter but incorrect position
  * Grey: incorrect letter


## NOTE:

The csv file of 5 letter words was created from [this GitHub page:](https://gist.github.com/shmookey/b28e342e1b1756c4700f42f17102c2ff.js)
